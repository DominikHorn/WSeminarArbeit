The aim of this tutorial is to explain genetic algorithms sufficiently for you 
to be able to use them in your own projects. This is a stripped-down 
to-the-bare-essentials type of tutorial. I'm not going to go into a great deal 
of depth and I'm not going to scare those of you with math anxiety by throwing 
evil 
equations at you every few sentences. In fact, I'm not going to throw any nasty equations at you at all! Not in this particular tutorial anyway... &lt;smile&gt;</font></p>

<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Every organism has a set of rules, a blueprint 
so to speak, describing how that organism is built up from the tiny building 
blocks of life. These rules are encoded in the </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> <i>genes</i></font><font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0"> of an 
organism, which in turn are connected together into long strings called </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> <i>
chromosomes</i></font><font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">. Each gene represents a specific trait of the organism, like eye 
colour or hair colour, and has several different settings. For example, the settings 
for a hair colour gene may be blonde, black 
or auburn. These genes and their  settings&nbsp;are usually referred to as an organism's </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> <i>genotype</i></font><font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">. The physical 
expression of the genotype - the organism itself - is called the </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> <i>phenotype</i></font><font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">.</font></span></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">When two organisms mate they share their 
genes. The resultant offspring may end up having half the genes from one parent 
and half from the other. This process is called </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> <i>recombination</i></font><font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">. Very 
occasionally a gene may be </font>
<font face="Arial" color="#FFFFCC"> <i>mutated</i></font><font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">. Normally this mutated gene will not 
affect the development of the phenotype but very occasionally it will be expressed in 
the organism as a completely new trait.</font></span></p>

<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0"><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Life on earth has evolved to be as it is 
through the processes of natural selection, recombination and mutation. To illustrate 
how these processes work together to produce the diverse range of flora and 
fauna we share our planet with let me tell you a little story....</font></span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><i><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Once upon a time there lived a species of 
creatures called Hooters. Hooters had evolved entirely within the darkened 
confines of a vast cave system hidden deep in the bowels of a mountain range. They'd had an easy life, feeling 
and smelling around the damp cave 
walls for the algae they so loved to eat, oozing between rocks and, at mating 
time, listening intently for the hoots of other Hooters. There were no 
predators in the caves, it was just the Hooters, the algae and the occasional 
friendly slug, so the Hooters never had anything to fear (except for maybe the 
occasional bad tempered Hooter). An underground river flowed through the cave 
system and water continuously dripped down through the water table bringing with 
it the fresh nutrients the algae thrived on so there was always plenty to eat 
and drink. 
However, although Hooters could feel and hear well they never had any need for eyes in 
the pitch blackness of the caves and as a result were totally blind. This never 
seemed to concern any of the Hooters though and they all had a whale of a time 
munching away and hooting in the darkness.</font></span></i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><i><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Then one day an earthquake caused part of the 
cave system to collapse and for the first time in many millennia the Hooters 
felt the warmth of sunlight upon their skin and the soft springiness of moss 
beneath their feet. A few daring Hooters tasted the moss and found that it was 
even better eating than the cave algae. "Ooooooooooh!" they hooted between mouthfuls of 
moss and promptly got gobbled up by the&nbsp; marauding eagles who had flown in to see 
what all the commotion was about. </font></span></i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><i><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">For a while it looked as though the Hooters 
may be hunted to extinction, for although they liked to eat the moss they could 
never tell if an eagle was flying above. Not only that, they couldn't even tell 
if they were concealed beneath a rock or not unless it was low enough to reach 
for with their feelers. Every day many Hooters would stumble out from the caves 
with the sweet smell of moss in their nostrils only to be swiftly carried away 
and eaten by an eagle. Their situation seemed grim indeed.</font></span></i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><i><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Fortunately, over the years,&nbsp; the 
population of Hooters had grown to be enormous in the safety of the caves and enough of them were surviving to mate 
- after all, an eagle can only eat so much. One day, 
a brood of Hooters was born that shared a mutated skin cell gene. This 
particular gene was responsible for the development of the skin cells on their 
foreheads. During the development of the baby Hooters, when their skin cells 
grew from the mutated gene instructions they were slightly light sensitive. Each 
new baby Hooter could sense if something was blocking the light to its forehead 
or not. When these little baby Hooters grew up into bigger Hooters and ventured 
into the light to eat the moss they could tell if something was swooping overhead or not. So these 
Hooters grew up to have a slightly better chance of survival than their totally 
blind cousins.&nbsp; And because they had a better chance of survival, they 
reproduced much more, therefore passing the new  light sensitive skin cell gene 
to their offspring. After a very short while the population became dominated by 
the Hooters with this slight advantage.</font></span></i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><i><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Now let's zip a few thousand generations into 
the future. If you extrapolate this process over very many years and involving 
lots of tiny mutations occurring in the skin cell genes it's easy to imagine a 
process where one light sensitive cell may become a clump of light sensitive 
cells, and then how the interior cells of the clump may mutate to harden into a tiny lens shaped area, which would help to 
gather the light and focus it into one place. It's not too difficult to envision a mutation 
that gives rise to two of these light gathering areas thereby bestowing 
binocular vision upon the Hooters. This would be a huge advantage over 
their Cyclopsian cousins as the Hooters would now be able to judge distances 
accurately and have a greater field of view.</font></span></i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0"><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">As you can see the processes of natural 
selection - survival of the fittest - and gene mutation have very powerful roles 
to play in the evolution of an organism. But how does recombination fit into the 
scheme of things? Well to show you that I need to tell about some other 
Hooters...</font></span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><i><span lang="en-gb">
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">At around the same time the Hooters with the 
light sensitive cells were frolicking around in the moss and teasing the eagles, 
another brood of Hooters had been born who shared a mutated gene that affected 
their hooter. This mutation gave rise to a slightly bigger hooter than their 
cousins, and because it was bigger they could now hoot over longer distances. 
This turned out to be useful in the rapidly diminishing population because the 
Hooters with the bigger hooters could call out to potential mates situated far 
away. Not only that but the female Hooters began to show a slight preference to 
males with larger hooters . The upshot of this of course was that the better 
endowed Hooters stood a much better chance of mating than any not so well off 
Hooters. Over a period of time, large hooters became prevalent in the 
population.</font></span></i></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; ">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0 30; "><span lang="en-gb"><i>
<font face="Arial" color="#C0C0C0">Then one fine day a female Hooter with the 
gene for light sensitive skin cells met a male Hooter with the gene for 
producing huge hooters. They fell in love, and shortly afterwards produced a 
brood of lovely baby Hooters. Now, because the babies chromosomes were a 
recombination of both parents chromosomes, some of the babies shared both the 
special genes and grew up not only to have light sensitive skin cells, but huge 
hooters too! These new offspring were extremely good at avoiding the eagles and 
reproducing so the process of evolution began to favour them and once again this 
new improved type of Hooter became dominant in the population.</font></i></span></p>

problems by mimicking the same processes mother nature uses. They use the same 
combination of selection, recombination and mutation to evolve a solution to a
