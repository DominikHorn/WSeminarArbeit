<span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#FFFFCC; text-decoration:underline">I understand all 
that but how do you actually <i>use</i> an artificial neuron?</span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Well, we have to link 
several of these neurons up in some way. One way of doing this is by organising 
the neurons into a design called a <font color="#FFFFCC"> <i>feedforward network</i></font>. It gets its name from 
the way the neurons in each layer feed their output forward to the next layer 
until we get the final output from the neural network. This is what a very 
simple feedforward network looks like:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="./Seite4_files/simple_feedforward_network.jpg" width="400" height="320"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">E</span><span style="font-family:Arial">ach 
input is sent to every neuron in the hidden layer and then each hidden layer’s 
neuron’s output is connected to every neuron in the next layer. There can be any 
number of hidden layers within a feedforward network but one is usually enough 
to suffice for most problems you will tackle. Also the number of neurons I've 
chosen for the above diagram was completely arbitrary. There can be any number 
of neurons in each layer, it all depends on the problem. By now you may be 
feeling a little dazed by all this information so I think the best thing I can 
do at this point would be to give you a real world example of how a neural net 
can be used in the hope that I can get your very own brain’s neurons firing! </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">You probably know already 
that a popular use for neural nets is character recognition. So let's design a 
neural network that will detect the number '4'. Given a panel made up of a grid 
of lights which can be either on or off, we want our neural net to let us know 
whenever it thinks it sees the character '4'. The panel is eight cells square 
and looks like this:</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;<img border="0" src="./Seite4_files/4grid.jpg" width="296" height="296"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">We would like to design a neural 
net that will accept the state of the panel as an input and will output&nbsp;either 
a 1 or zero. A 1 to indicate that it thinks the character ‘4’ is being displayed 
and 0 if it thinks it's not being displayed. Therefore the neural net will have 
64 inputs, each one representing a particular cell in the panel and a hidden 
layer consisting of a number of neurons (more on this later) all feeding their 
output into just one neuron in the output layer. I hope you can picture this in 
your head because the thought of drawing all those little circles and lines for 
you is not a happy one &lt;smile&gt;.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">Once the neural network has 
been created it needs to be trained. One way of doing this is initialize the neural 
net with random weights and then feed it a series of inputs which represent, in 
this example, the different panel configurations. For each configuration we 
check to see what its output is and adjust the weights accordingly so that 
whenever it sees something looking like a number 4 it outputs a 1 and for 
everything else it outputs a zero. This type of training is called <i>
<font color="#FFFFCC">supervised 
learning</font> </i>and the data we feed it is called a <font color="#FFFFCC"> <i>training set</i></font>. There are 
many different ways of adjusting the weights, the most common for this type of 
problem is called <font color="#FFFFCC"> <i>backpropagation</i></font>. I will not be going into backprop in 
this tutorial as I will be showing you a completely different way of training 
neural nets which requires no supervision whatsoever (and hardly any maths - 
woohoo!)</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial">I</span><span style="font-family:Arial">f 
you think about it, you could increase the outputs of this neural net to 10.&nbsp; 
This way the network can be trained to recognize all the digits 0 through to 9. 
Increase them further and it could be trained to recognize the alphabet too!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial">Are you 
starting to get a feel for neural nets now? I hope so. But even if you’re not 
all that will hopefully change in a moment when you start to see some code.</span></p>
