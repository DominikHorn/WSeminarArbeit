That solution works pretty well, but i was wondering if encountering that phenomena was normal and if not how can you avoid it.\u003cbr>Waiting for your answer, i wish you a good day :-)\u003c/p>\u003cp>Ps: sorry for my english, which may be inacurate\u003c/p>","isSpam":false,"isHighlighted":false,"points":1},{"forum":"gamedevtuts","parent":1391359906,"isApproved":true,"author":{"username":"randygaul","about":"","name":"RandyGaul","disable3rdPartyTrackers":false,"isPowerContributor":false,"isAnonymous":false,"rep":1.280023,"profileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/randygaul/","url":"","signedProfileUrl":"https://disqus.com/by/randygaul/","reputation":1.280023,"location":"","isPrivate":false,"isPrimary":true,"joinedAt":"2013-05-20T06:52:19","id":"51289925","avatar":{"small":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/randygaul.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/5128/9925/avatar32.jpg?1428992806"},"isCustom":true,"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/randygaul.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/5128/9925/avatar92.jpg?1428992806","large":{"permalink":"http://disqus.com/api/users/avatars/randygaul.jpg","cache":"//a.disquscdn.com/uploads/users/5128/9925/avatar92.jpg?1428992806"}}},"media":[],"isDeleted":false,"isFlagged":false,"dislikes":0,"raw_message":"Hi!

<p>Was this not reviewed? In the velocity resolution section you first write</p><p>VAB⋅n=(VB−VA)⋅n</p><p>and then</p><p>VAB⋅n=−e∗(VB−VA)⋅n</p><p>Makes no sense, should be V'AB. Equation 9 has VV instead of VB, it's so confusing. I know how to solve the response impulse already, and it took me good 20 minutes to figure out what the hell was going on with your math. I can't imagine what somebody who's just learning had to do to understand this mess.</p>

<p>And Equation 9 is not combining equations 8 and 5.</p><p>(VA−VV+j∗nmassA+j∗nmassB)∗n</p><p>First of all, it should be dot n, not * n. Second of all, the part in the brackets is wrong, you calculate VAB as VB - VA and in the brackets you're calculating V'A - V'B. This would be correct if you used the derived VA and VB from the V'A and V'B equations and, as usual, wrote it wrong, but you clearly are not since in the latter parts you use them interchangeably. So your signs are now completely wrong, even though by some miracle you came up with</p><p>(VB−VA)</p><p>in Equation 10, which WOULD BE correct if you didn't make all those mistakes.</p><p>Equation 10 makes no sense either. You get this</p><p>j∗(j∗nmassA+j∗nmassB)</p><p>from</p><p>j∗nmassA+j∗nmassB</p><p>Elementary mistakes, i mean come on...</p><p>This looks like you read the solution in a book, and then you came up with the equations by working backwards from it.

<p>Without looking back at my equations, it looks like you're not taking into account that a lot of the dot products are redundant if you're dealing with a normalized contact normal.</p><p>I know the derivation is correct because I used it in my own code and tested it. Other people have used this article as a reference and created working simulations as well.</p><p>Also you keep getting caught up in notation. If you don't like the notation there's not really anything anyone can do about it. I suggest finding a derivation elsewhere.</p>

<p>"a lot of the dot products are redundant if you're dealing with a normalized contact normal."</p><p>The only time a dot product "is redundant" is when a normalized vector is dotted with itself and then multiplied and that happens once, when the j is calculated at the end.</p><p>The calculations are wrong, i'm not getting caught in the notation.</p><p>Yes, the result is correct, that's because, as i said, it was probably looked up in a book and worked from backwards. But in case somebody tried to ACTUALLY LEARN how to this is done, the whole section is a mathematical fallacy and should not have past the review process.</p>

<p>Hi,</p><p>Awesome tutorial.</p><p>I’m having a probleme with the<br>AABBvsAABB(manifold m). If xOverlap &gt; yOverlap, doesn’t it means that the<br>axis of least penetration is y? Shouldn't we set the normal as (0,1) or (0,-1)  and the<br>penetration as yOverlap?<br>Also there is a case in that method where you set your normal as (0,0), guess thats a typo?</p><p>Thanks again</p>

<p>I noticed the x_overlap &gt; y_overlap issue as well. I was wondering why I was getting some strange results. If we're resolving on the axis with the least penetration, it should be x_overlap &lt; y_overlap in this case I'm pretty sure.</p><p>Great tutorial though, I learned a lot.</p>

<p>Thank you for the tutorial. Unfortunately I can't get it to work when I translated it to JavaScript. It appears the min overlap detection is somehow wrong (it chooses the larger overlap!), but my efforts to fix it didn't work.</p><p>Also, I think you made a mistake with:<br>if (velAlongNormal &gt; 0) return;</p><p>This makes it so that it will actually ignore all collisions where the objects are heading straight for one another (which includes the intended case, where they're heading directly away--same velocities though).</p><p>You may see what I've done here: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/vJtUr/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/vJtUr/</a></p><p>You can just do a search for the functions overlapAABB and resolveCollision to see my implementation (only overlapAABB is being used there currently, but you can switch it in tick().</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Hi, I followed your tutorial and I made some changes to obtain a simple physics engine with AABBvsAABB, CirclevsCircle and AABBvsCircle only (no rotation, friction... so far). When I do AABBvsAABB collision (and AABBvsCircle) and two box collide one near the center of the other, all goes fine. But when one is near the "end" of a bigger one (like in the image), it passes through it. I've tried many things, non with success. My resolveCollision code is the same as yours.</p><p>Below my AABBvsAABB code:</p><p>void AABBvsAABB(AABB box1, AABB box2) {</p><p>   Vector normal = new Vector(box2.getCenter().getX() - box1.getCenter().getX(), box2.getCenter().getY() - box1.getCenter().getY());</p><p>  //Calculate the extent on the X axis<br>  float aExtent = box1.getWidth() / 2;</p><p>  float bExtent = box2.getWidth() / 2;</p><p>  //Find the X overlap<br>  float xExtent = aExtent + bExtent - Math.abs(normal.getX());</p><p>  //SAT Test on X<br>  if (xExtent &gt; 0) {</p><p>      //There was overlap on the X axis, now lets try to Y<br>      aExtent = box1.getHeight() / 2;<br>      bExtent = box2.getHeight() / 2;</p><p>      //Calculate Y overlap<br>      float yExtent = aExtent + bExtent - Math.abs(normal.getY());</p><p>      //SAT Test on Y axis<br>      if (yExtent &gt; 0){</p><p>          //Find which axis has the biggest penetration ;D<br>          if (xExtent &gt; yExtent){</p><p>              normal.normalize(box1.getCenter(), box2.getCenter());</p><p>              resolveCollision(box1, box2, normal);</p><p>          }</p><p>         else {</p><p>            normal.normalize(box1.getCenter(), box2.getCenter());</p><p>            resolveCollision(box1, box2, normal);</p><p>         }<br>      }<br>   }<br>}</p>

<p>Nice tutorial!</p><p>Is it possible that you are calculating the distance between the 2 circles wrong?<br>I believe it should be<br>     sqrt((a.x  - b.x)^2 + (a.y - b.y)^2)<br>instead of<br>     sqrt(((a.x + b.x)^2 + (a.y + b.y)^2)</p><p>Take the points A(1|2) and B(4|6)</p><p>your result would be sqrt((1+4)^2 + (2+6)^2)=sqrt(25+64)=sqrt(91)= ~9.53<br>but it shoulr be sqrt((1-4)^2 + (2-6)^2)=sqrt(9+16)=sqrt(25)=5</p>

<p>You should change: "return  r &lt; (a.x + b.x)^2 + (a.y + b.x)^2", in CirclevsCircleOptimized, one of the first code blocks. It should be:<br>"return r &gt; (a.x - b.x)^2 + (a.y - b.y)^2". We want to check if the squared sum of the circle radii is greater than the euclidean distance between the circles. If it is, then the circles must be overlapping and it should return true.</p><p>Although it's frustrating with typos in code tutorials, I think it could be a good thing, as it forces the readers to actually think for themselves! ;)</p>

<p>Hrm, so I looked at the three of these and I managed to find the sourcecode on the youtube video for this; so far my criticism would be that you didn't stick to a single language and that it isn't a good step-by-step tutorial in the sense that beginners could compile code at each step and see results. I feel like reading this tutorial I need to have 100% of everything before I can hit compile and I'm super lost. It should begin with a simple/trivial example of a ball and a box maybe bouncing and then go up from there.</p>

<p>Hey Eli, fair criticism! This is intended to be an advanced tutorial, but I realise it could be much more approachable even so (or at least, we could provide a more approachable version). I'm not in contact with the instructor who wrote this at the moment, but I have put a call out for instructors to write a new tutorial on this topic. Watch this space...</p>

<p>Hello, at first thank you for awesome tutorial.<br>While I made a ResolveCollision, I met a problem so I seek your advice.<br>You said what use more smaller one in restitution. But I found that gainable one restitution. <br>Restitution = abs(V2f - V1f / V2i - V1f)<br>Like this, so how can i get each two restitution?<br>Sorry for not good at my english</p>

<p>Sorry, Evan, I'm afraid I don't think the instructor reads these comments any more. (To be fair, it has been two years!) Perhaps try asking your question at <a href="http://gamedev.stackexchange.com/" rel="nofollow">http://gamedev.stackexchange.c...</a> ?</p>

<p>I was a little hesitant to try and implement the code considering how many comments there are pointing out typos and errors, but your writing was too simply and straightforward for me not to grasp :)  I used the lessons for my collision solver to implement circle vs circle and circle vs line collision and it worked like a dream!  Thanks very much for making such a comprehensive and comprehensive tutorial.</p>

<p>In the end of the last code snippet, shouldn't it be m-&gt;penetration = r - d instead of m-&gt;penetration = r + d? This is because the d represents the distance between the closest point on the rectangle and the center of the circle. Therefore, r - d would give you the distance between the penetrating part of the circle and the closest point on the rectangle.</p>

<p>Hello, i just finished my physic engine (with frictions and rotations), and i had one thing to ask you<br>I wanted first to thank you a lot for your tutorial, i would have never succeed without it.<br>I also had a question about the positionnal correction module. In my physical engine, when two bodies collides, the resolution of the collision occures and gives new velocities to the bodies. But it can happen that these two bodies are not separated yet when the next resolution occures. Consequently, this resolution will add velocity again and that will be a surplus of velocity. So, the percent of the positionnal correction module need to be fixed at 1 in my engine. That solution works pretty well, but i was wondering if encountering that phenomena was normal and if not how can you avoid it.<br>Waiting for your answer, i wish you a good day :-)</p><p>Ps: sorry for my english, which may be inacurate</p>

<p>Hi! Good question. The problem you are observing is that each solution (impulse) is calculated and applied in isolation of all other solutions. The solution is to solve for each impulse like a linear algebra problem of solving a system of equations.</p><p>Currently the most popular approach is to implemented Projected Gauss Seidel, an iterative LCP solver. The actual implementation you seek comes down to storing impulses from frame to frame, and clamping the accumulated result above zero. This will let negative impulses by applied when necessary, and helps to drive convergence over the course of multiple frames.</p><p>This topic is a bit involved so don't feel bad if it's difficult to implement at first! There's a lot of information to learn.</p>

<p>Hi there !</p><p>I've been reading your tutorial for some days, trying to build my own engine from my math/physics courses. The only internet I had was my cell phone and a crappy network.</p><p>You tutorial is quite good, you explain most of it well, and it was indeed of a great help to me. But it is full of mistakes and untold things ! I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what you were trying to say or do with some code.</p><p>(Example : "m-&gt;normal = Vec2( 0, 0 )" in rectVsRect collision. This is an easy one. Thre is no "return false;" eather. The hardest is when you use a var you never declared. ^^)</p><p>Still, I don't want to be mean. Your tutorial helped me a lot, bu you really should proof read it.</p><p>Thanks anyway, nice job ! ;)</p><p>(PS : IMO, you tend to spend to much time explaining the math, thus forgetting the physics. Like why to use a dot product. You explained the maths but not really the projection idea. That was my last critic. :P )</p>

<p>Still, I quickly checked the 3 other pages of tutorial that I cannot see with my poor phone connection, this seems to be a really good piece of work.</p><p>Have you seen that Metanet (N+ team) also released some tutorials and data around their games ? This is very sweet too, their flash applets help a lot ! <a href="http://www.metanetsoftware.com/technique.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanetsoftware.com...</a><br>(Those guys are awesome.)</p>
